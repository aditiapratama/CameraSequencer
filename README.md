# Camera Sequencer
Camera Sequencer aims to provide a shot list interface for Blender's native timeline. It allows you to create shots, define their duration, keep notes, rearrange them, and reallocate cameras.

## Clean Up Cameras
This operator removes all unused cameras, and renames the ones that remain.

## Enable Dynamic Note
Enables a handler that prints the current shot's note on the rendered frame. Works via Blender's native output settings.
